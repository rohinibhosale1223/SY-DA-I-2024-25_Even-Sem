                <p>A beginner's guide to understanding the basics of coding with Python.<br><br>Python has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages in the world, renowned for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.

Prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and importance is another essential strategy. The Eisenhower Matrix, which categorizes tasks into four quadrants (urgent/important, not urgent/important, urgent/not important, and not urgent/not important), provides a useful framework for prioritizing your workload.<br><br>Creating a daily or weekly schedule can help you allocate time for specific tasks and activities.
